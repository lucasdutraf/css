# CSS Learning

## About CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

## Personal Objectives
My goal with learning css during summer vacation is to improve my skills with this tool and get more familiar with front-end development, focusing to be a full-stack developer, status that it is important for me as a Software Engineering student.
